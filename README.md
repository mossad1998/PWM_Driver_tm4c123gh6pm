# PWM_Driver_tm4c123gh6pm
This Driver enables you to initialize PWM Peripherals and use them in a simple way to help accelerate the design cycle.  
There is one Example to demonstrate this Driver:  
1.PWM Channel with variable frequency and duty cycle  
  
the Example is set with 10Khz and Duty cycle 20%
  
  
you need to Connect GND to ground and B7 to receive the pwm signal
